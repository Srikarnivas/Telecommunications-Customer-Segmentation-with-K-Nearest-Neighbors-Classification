Telecommunications Customer Segmentation with K-Nearest Neighbors Classification
Overview
This project aims to predict customer segmentation for a telecommunications provider using demographic data such as region, age, and marital status. The classification model is built using the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which categorizes customers into four groups: Basic Service, E-Service, Plus Service, and Total Service.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains demographic information about customers along with their corresponding segmentation labels (custcat). Features include region, age, marital status, and more.
